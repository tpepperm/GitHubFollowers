# GitHubFollowers
## An app to check GitHub followers of a user
###### This is an app I created following Sean Allen's take home project course. 
UI was made completely programmatically, without using a storyboard. I practiced working with RESTful API's (a GutHub one), making network calls, creating collection views with diffable data source and many more üèπ
